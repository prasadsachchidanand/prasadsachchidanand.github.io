A way to construct the sequence is as follows. Without loss of generality assume that $a > 0$. Between $0$ and $a$, due to density of rationals in reals, there exists a rational number, say $q_1$. Similarly, get another rational number $q_2$ such that $0 < q_1 < q_2 < a$. In the similar way, we get a sequence of increasing rationals $0 < q_1 < q_2 < \\dots < q_n < \\dots < a$ which converges to $a$. Now to show that $f$ is discontinuous at $a$, note that \n    \\[\n        \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} f(q_n) = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} 1 = 1, \n    \\]  \n    whereas, $f(a) = 0$. Thus, $f$ is not continuous at $a$. As $a$ was arbitrarily chosen irrational number, $f$ is not continuous at any irrational number. \n    \n  <br> <br>  Thus $f$ is discontinuous at every real number.</div>",
