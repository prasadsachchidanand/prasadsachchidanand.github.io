                                    We denote by $\text{ex}(n, H, F)$ the maximum number of copies of $H$ in an $n$-vertex graph that does not contain $F$ as a subgraph. Recently, Grzesik, Gy≈ëri, Salia, Tompkins considered conditions on $H$ under which $\text{ex}(n, H, K_r)$ is asymptotically attained at a blow-up of $K_{r-1}$, and proposed a conjecture. In this note we disprove their conjecture.

                                    Twin-width is a recently introduced graph parameter. In this article, we compute twin-width of various finite graphs. In particular, we prove that the twin-widths of finite graphs with 4 and 5 vertices are less than equal to 1 and 2, respectively. We show that the constructions of dual graph and line graph do not preserve twin-width. Also, we give upper bounds for the twin-width of King's graph and Rook's graph.

                                    We present a simple proof of the surface classification theorem using normal curves. This proof is analogous to Kneser's and Milnor's proof of the existence and uniqueness of the prime decomposition of 3-manifolds. In particular, we do not need any invariants from algebraic topology to distinguish surfaces.

                                    Path graphs are intersection graphs of paths in a tree. We start from the characterization of path graphs by Monma and Wei [C.L.~Monma,~and~V.K.~Wei, Intersection Graphs of Paths in a Tree, J. Combin. Theory Ser. B, 41:2 (1986) 141--181] and we reduce it to some 2-colorings subproblems, obtaining the first characterization that directly leads to a polynomial recognition algorithm. Then we introduce the collection of the attachedness graphs of a graph and we exhibit a list of minimal forbidden 2-edge colored subgraphs in each of the attachedness graph.

                                    We use a dynamic programming algorithm to establish a new lower bound on the domination number of complete cylindrical grid graphs of the form $C_n\square P_m$, that is, the Cartesian product of a path and a cycle, when $n\equiv 2\pmod{5}$, and we establish a new upper bound equal to the lower bound, thus computing the exact domination number for these graphs.

                                    We investigate harmonic mappings $f=h+\bar{g}$ defined in the unit disk, where $g$ and $h$ satisfy certain prescribed conditions and the analytic part $h$ belongs to the Ma and Minda class of starlike functions. Certain sharp radius results for univalency, close-to-convexity, fully starlikeness, fully convexity, and radius of strongly starlikeness are established. We also calculate the radius of uniformly starlikeness and convexity for these functions. Several results enhance the well-known radius results.

                                    The fundamental quandle is a powerful invariant of knots, links and spatial graphs, but it is often difficult to determine whether two quandles are isomorphic. One approach is to look at quotients of the quandle, such as the $n$-quandle defined by Joyce \cite{JO}; in particular, Hoste and Shanahan \cite{HS2} classified the knots and links with finite $n$-quandles. Mellor and Smith \cite{MS} introduced the $N$-quandle of a link as a generalization of Joyce's $n$-quandle, and proposed a classification of the links with finite $N$-quandles. We generalize the $N$-quandle to spatial graphs, and investigate which spatial graphs have finite $N$-quandles. We prove basic results about $N$-quandles for spatial graphs, and conjecture a classification of spatial graphs with finite $N$-quandles, extending the conjecture for links in \cite{MS}. We verify the conjecture in several cases, and also present a possible counterexample.

                                    A homology and cohomology theory for topological quandles are introduced. The relation between these (co)homology groups and quandle (co)homology groups are studied. The 1 - topological quandle cocycles are used to compute state sum invariants corresponding to knot diagrams.

                                    Localization methods are ubiquitous in cyclic homology theory, but vary in detail and are used in different scenarios. In this paper we will elaborate on a common feature of localization methods in noncommutative geometry, namely sheafification of the algebra under consideration and reduction of the computation to the stalks of the sheaf. The novelty of our approach lies in the methods we use which mainly stem from real instead of complex algebraic geometry. We will then indicate how this method can be used to determine the Hochschild homology theory of more complicated algebras out of simpler ones.

                                    In this paper, we first establish several theorems about the estimation of distance function on real and strongly convex complex Finsler manifolds and then obtain a Schwarz lemma from a strongly convex weakly K√§hler-Finsler manifold into a strongly pseudoconvex complex Finsler manifold. As applications, we prove that a holomorphic mapping from a strongly convex weakly K√§hler-Finsler manifold into a strongly pseudoconvex complex Finsler manifold is necessary constant under an extra condition. In particular, we prove that a holomorphic mapping from a complex Minkowski space into a strongly pseudoconvex complex Finsler manifold such that its holomorphic sectional curvature is bounded from above by a negative constant is necessary constant.

                                    A perfect cuboid is formed when an Euler brick whose edges and face diagonals are all integers also has an integer internal diagonal. No simple, succinct perfect cuboid has been found. It is known that if a perfect cuboid exists the internal diagonal is odd. This algebraic proof shows in a succinct way that by replacing the edges and diagonal integers in the perfect cuboid with the Euclidean substitutions for deriving all the Pythagorean triples, the internal diagonal cannot be an odd integer.

                                    The main cases of interest for physical applications of the generalized Stokes' theorem are visualized using the language of geometric algebra. From considering bivector valued fields, two seldom used instances of the theorem are obtained. In three dimensions a radial spin structure, dual to the divergence theorem, is found to generalize the curl theorem whilst a solution akin to the Clifford torus is uncovered in four-dimensional space. Dualities and applications to natural phenomena are discussed. The relation to the non-Abelian Stokes theorem is briefly touched upon.

                                    The basis for most of the ideas mentioned in this paper is the theory of cellular automata. A cellular automata contains a regular grid of cells, with each cell having a pre-defined set of finite states. The initial state is determined at time/state zero. At this point all the cells are assigned their respective starting states. The automata is defined by a set of simple rules that decide the subsequent states of the cells. We aim to create a cellular automata of prime numbers and come up with some axioms, theorems and conjectures for the same.

Applying the result of G. Wang and Z. Xu on the 61-stem in the stable homotopy groups of spheres, we find that the Kervaire invariant one elements in dimensions 62 and 126 exist.

                                    The Collatz conjecture is a famous math problem that was introduced by Lothar Collatz in 1937, and nobody has yet succeeded in proving or disproving it. In this article, I will analyze this problem with a new approach and I will discuss my important findings that are helpful in getting closer to the proof of this unsolved problem in mathematics.

If $M$ is connected, then Vol($W$) < $2^{49}$Vol($M$). This applies for instance to the Borromean link complement. As a consequence, the Borromean link complement bounds geometrically a hyperbolic 4-manifold.

                                    In the area of cryptography, fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) enables any entity to perform arbitrary computation on encrypted data without decrypting the ciphertexts. An ongoing group-theoretic approach to construct FHE schemes uses a certain "compression" function $F(x)$ implemented by group operators on a given finite group $G$ (i.e., it is given by a sequence of elements of $G$ and variable $x$), which satisfies that $F(1) = 1$ and $F(\sigma) = F(\sigma^2) = \sigma$ where $\sigma \in G$ is some element of order three. The previous work gave an example of such $F$ over $G = S_5$ by just a heuristic approach. In this paper, we systematically study the possibilities of such $F$. We construct a shortest possible $F$ over smaller group $G = A_5$, and prove that no such $F$ exists over other groups $G$ of order up to $60 = |A_5|$.

                                    For certain elliptic differential operators $L,$ we study the behaviour of solutions to $Lu=0,$ as we tend to the boundary along radii in strictly starlike domains in $\mathbb{R}^n, n\ge 3.$ Analogous results are obtained in other special domains. Our approach involves introducing harmonic line bundles as instances of Brelot harmonic spaces and approximating continuous functions by harmonic functions on appropriate subsets. These approximation theorems on harmonic spaces yield interesting examples for approximation by solutions of $Lu=0$ on some domains in $\mathbb{R}^n.$

                                    The paper is devoted to studying the orthogonality graph of the matrix ring over a commutative ring. It is proved that the orthogonality graph of the ring of matrices with size greater than 1 over a commutative ring with zero-divisors is connected and has diameter 3 or 4; a criterion for each value is obtained. It is also shown that each of its vertices has distance at most 2 from some scalar matrix.

                                    We show that for a generic Riemannian or reversible Finsler metric on a compact differentiable manifold $M$ of dimension at least three all closed geodesics are simple and do not intersect each other. Using results by Contreras~\cite{C2010} \cite{C2011} this shows that for a generic Riemannian metric on a compact and simply-connected manifold all closed geodesics are simple and the number $N(t)$ of geometrically distinct closed geodesics of length $\le t$ grows exponentially.

                                    We prove an effective version of a theorem relating curve complex distance to electric distance in hyperbolic 3-manifolds, up to errors that are polynomial in the complexity of the underlying surface. We use this to give an effective proof of a result regarding maps between curve complexes of surfaces induced by finite covers. As applications, we effectively relate the electric circumference of a fibered manifold to the curve complex translation length of its monodromy, and we give quantitative bounds on virtual specialness for cube complexes dual to curves on surfaces.

                                    This article provides new asymptotic results for the summatory Mobius function $\sum_{p \leq x} \mu(p+a) =O \left (x(\log x)^{-c} \right )$ and the summatory Liouville function $\sum_{p \leq x} \lambda(p+a) =O \left (x(\log x)^{-c} \right )$ over the shifted primes, where $a\ne0$ is a fixed parameter, and $c>1$ is an arbitrary constant. These results improve the current estimates $\sum_{p \leq x} \mu(p+a)=(1-\delta)\pi(x)$, and $\sum_{p \leq x} \lambda(p+a)=(1-\delta)\pi(x)$ for $\delta>0$, respectively. Furthermore, a conditional proof for the autocorrelation function $\sum_{p \leq x} \mu(p+a)\mu(p+b) =O \left (x(\log x)^{-c} \right )$, and an unconditional proof for the autocorrelation function $\sum_{p \leq x} \lambda(p+a)\lambda(p+b) =O \left (x(\log x)^{-c} \right )$ over the shifted primes, where $a\ne b$, are also included.

                                    We prove a conjecture of D. Oberlin on the dimension of unions of lines in $\mathbb{R}^n$. If $d \geq 1$ is an integer, $0 \leq \beta \leq 1$, and $L$ is a set of lines in $\mathbb{R}^n$ with Hausdorff dimension at least $2(d-1) + \beta$, then the union of the lines in $L$ has Hausdorff dimension at least $d + \beta$. Our proof combines a refined version of the multilinear Kakeya theorem by Carbery and Valdimarsson with the multilinear to linear argument of Bourgain and Guth.

                                    In this paper, we first study the $\alpha-$energy functional, Euler-Lagrange operator and $\alpha$-stress energy tensor. Second, it is shown that the critical points of $\alpha-$ energy functional are explicitly related to harmonic maps through conformal deformation. In addition, an $\alpha-$harmonic map is constructed from any smooth map between Riemannian manifolds under certain assumptions. Next, we determine the conditions under which the fibers of horizontally conformal $\alpha-$ harmonic maps are minimal submanifolds. Then, the stability of any $\alpha-$harmonic map from a Riemannian manifold to a Riemannian manifold with non-positive Riemannian curvature is demonstrated. Finally, the instability of $\alpha-$harmonic maps from a compact manifold to a standard unit sphere is investigated.

                                    Sturm's Theorem is a fundamental 19th century result relating the number of real roots of a polynomial $f$ in an interval to the number of sign alternations in a sequence of polynomial division-like calculations. We provide a short direct proof of Sturm's Theorem, including the numerically vexing case (ignored in many published accounts) where an interval endpoint is a root of $f$.

                                    Suppose $T$ is a Heegaard splitting surface for a compact orientable 3-manifold $M$, and $S$ is a reducing sphere for $M$. In 1968 Haken showed that there is then also a reducing sphere $S^*$&nbsp; for the Heegaard splitting. That is, $S^*$&nbsp; is a reducing sphere for $M$ and the surfaces $T$ and $S^*$&nbsp; intersect in a single circle. In 1987 Casson and Gordon extended the result to boundary-reducing disks in $M$ and noted that in both cases $S^*$&nbsp; is obtained from $S$ by a sequence of operations called 1-surgeries. Here we show that in fact one may take $S^* = S$.

                                    A pedagogical but concise overview of Riemannian geometry is provided, in the context of usage in physics. The emphasis is on defining and visualizing concepts and relationships between them, as well as listing common confusions, alternative notations and jargon, and relevant facts and theorems. Special attention is given to detailed figures and geometric viewpoints, some of which would seem to be novel to the literature. Topics are avoided which are well covered in textbooks, such as historical motivations, proofs and derivations, and tools for practical calculations. As much material as possible is developed for manifolds with connection (omitting a metric) to make clear which aspects can be readily generalized to gauge theories. The presentation in most cases does not assume a coordinate frame or zero torsion, and the coordinate-free, tensor, and Cartan formalisms are developed in parallel.

We present a version of (DEC) on cubic cell, defining it for discrete manifolds. An example of how it works, it is done on the discrete torus, where usual Gauss and Stokes theorems are recovered.

                                    A periodic cell complex, $K$, has a finite representation as the quotient space, $q(K)$, consisting of equivalence classes of cells identified under the translation group acting on $K$. We study how the Betti numbers and cycles of $K$ are related to those of $q(K)$, first for the case that $K$ is a graph, and then higher-dimensional cell complexes. When $K$ is a $d$-periodic graph, it is possible to define $\mathbb{Z}^d$-weights on the edges of the quotient graph and this information permits full recovery of homology generators for $K$. The situation for higher-dimensional cell complexes is more subtle and studied in detail using the Mayer-Vietoris spectral sequence.

                                    Let $\Gamma$ be a finite group acting on a Lie group $G$. We consider a class of group extensions $1 \to G \to \hat{G} \to \Gamma \to 1$ defined by this action and a $2$-cocycle of $\Gamma$ with values in the centre of $G$. We establish and study a correspondence between $\hat{G}$-bundles on a manifold and twisted $\Gamma$-equivariant bundles with structure group $G$ on a suitable Galois $\Gamma$-covering of the manifold. We also describe this correspondence in terms of non-abelian cohomology. Our results apply, in particular, to the case of a compact or reductive complex Lie group $\hat{G}$, since such a group is always isomorphic to an extension as above, where $G$ is the connected component of the identity and $\Gamma$ is the group of connected components of $\hat{G}$.

                                    In this paper we give an elementary proof of the proper homotopy invariance of the equivariant stable homotopy type of the configuration space $F(M,k)$ for a topological manifold $M$. Our technique is to compute the Spanier-Whitehead dual of $F(M,k)_+$ and use Wall's results about normal spherical fibrations to deduce that the Spanier-Whitehead dual is a proper homotopy invariant. This stable invariance was recently proved by Knudsen using factorization homology. Aside from being elementary, our proof has the advantage that it readily extends to "generalized configuration spaces" which have recently undergone study.

                                    We provide a short proof that the dimensions of the mod $p$ homology groups of the unordered configuration space $B_k(\Sigma_g)$ of $k$ points in a genus $g$ surface are the same as its Betti numbers for $p>2$, $g\geq 1$, and $k\leq p$. Hence the integral homology has no $p$-power torsion.

                                    We study finite-dimensional nonassociative algebras. We prove the implicit function theorem for such algebras. This allows us to establish a correspondence between such algebras and quasigroups, in the spirit of classical correspondence between divisible torsion-free nilpotent groups and rational nilpotent Lie algebras. We study the related questions of the commensurators of nilpotent groups, filiform Lie algebras of maximal solvability length and partially ordered algebras.

                                    We introduce a combinatorial argument to study closed minimal hypersurfaces of bounded area and high Morse index. Let $(M^{n+1},g)$ be a closed Riemannian manifold and $\Sigma\subset M$ be a closed embedded minimal hypersurface with area at most $A>0$ and with a singular set of Hausdorff dimension at most $n-7$. We show the following bounds: there is $C_A>0$ depending only on $n$, $g$, and $A$ so that $$\sum_{i=0}^n b^i(\Sigma) \leq C_A \big(1+index(\Sigma)\big) \quad \text{ if $3\leq n+1\leq 7$},$$ $$\mathcal{H}^{n-7}\big(Sing(\Sigma)\big) \leq C_A \big(1+index(\Sigma)\big)^{7/n} \quad \text{ if $n+1\geq 8$},$$ where $b^i$ denote the Betti numbers over any field, $\mathcal{H}^{n-7}$ is the $(n-7)$-dimensional Hausdorff measure and $Sing(\Sigma)$ is the singular set of $\Sigma$. In fact in dimension $n+1=3$, $C_A$ depends linearly on $A$. We list some open problems at the end of the paper.

                                    The Analyst's Traveling Salesman Problem is to find a characterization of subsets of rectifiable curves in a metric space. This problem was introduced and solved in the plane by Jones in 1990 and subsequently solved in higher-dimensional Euclidean spaces by Okikiolu in 1992 and in the infinite-dimensional Hilbert space $\ell_2$ by Schul in 2007. In this paper, we establish sharp extensions of Schul's necessary and sufficient conditions for a bounded set $E\subset\ell_p$ to be contained in a rectifiable curve from $p=2$ to $1 < p < \infty$. While the necessary and sufficient conditions coincide when $p=2$, we demonstrate that there is a strict gap between the necessary condition and sufficient condition when $p\neq 2$. We also identify and correct technical errors in the proof by Schul. This investigation is partly motivated by recent work of Edelen, Naber, and Valtorta on Reifenberg-type theorems in Banach spaces and complements work of Hahlomaa and recent work of David and Schul on the Analyst's TSP in general metric spaces.
